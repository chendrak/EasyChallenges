# EasyCards

#### Custom Cards Made Easy
This mod allows you to easily add custom cards into the game by specifying them in `JSON` files.

To add your own cards, create a new folder inside `BepInEx\plugins` and create a new `.cards.json` file (like `custompack.cards.json`) inside that folder.
An example structure could look like this:

```
BepInEx
  - plugins
    - ChendraksCardPack
      - ccp.cards.json
      - Assets
        - card1.png
        - card2.png
```

EasyCards will scan for `*.cards.json` files in `BepInEx\plugins` subfolders.

Then start up the game and go to `Stat -> Soul Cards`. If everything went well, your cards should show up.

The full file format is specified below.

## Troubleshooting
If your cards don't show up, please check `BepInEx\LogOutput.log` and `BepInEx\ErrorLog.log` for potential ideas as to why.
If there is no information in the logs, you can enable additional logs by opening `BepInEx\config\EasyCards.cfg` and setting
`LogCards = true`. After saving the file, restart the app and EasyCards will log A LOT of information about your cards and
maybe give you additional information.

If all else fails, feel free to swing by the [Rogue: Genesia Discord](https://discord.gg/WbrgtCaP4T) and ask there.

}
```

## Card Properties

### Rarity
The rarity of the card.

Possible values: `Tainted`, `Normal`, `Uncommon` , `Rare`, `Epic`, `Heroic`, `Ascended`, `Evolution`

### Tags
Tags for your card. Think of them as grouping them.

Possible values: `None`, `Order`, `Critical`, `Defence`, `Body`, `Might`, `Evolution`

### DisabledInMode
Represents the mode this card will be disabled in.

Possible values: `Rogs`, `Survivors`

### Modifiers
Specifies modifiers that the card applies to your stats.

Example:
```json
{
  "ModifierValue": 15,
  
  // Specifies HOW the `ModifierValue` is applied
  "ModifierType": "Additional",
  
  // Specifies WHICH stat this modifier applies to
  "Stat": "CriticalChance"
}
```

#### Stat
A stat that your card modifies.

Possible values: `MaxHealth`, `HealthRegen`, `Defence`, `DamageMitigation`, `XPMultiplier`, `PickUpDistance`, `AdditionalProjectile`, `ProjectilePiercing`, `ProjectileLifeTime`, `ProjectileSpeed`, `ProjectileSize`, `AreaSize`, `KnockBack`, `MoveSpeed`, `AttackCoolDown`, `AttackDelay`, `Damage`, `CriticalChance`, `CriticalMultiplier`, `DashSpeed`, `DashDuration`, `DashDelay`, `DashCoolDown`, `DashCharge`, `DashChargePerCoolDown`, `GoldMultiplier`, `SoulCoinMultiplier`, `DefencePiercing`, `Corruption`

#### ModifierType
_How_ does your card modify a stat?

Possible values: `Additional`, `Multiplier`, `Compound`

**NOTE:** For most multiplication cases, you will want to use `Compound`, especially for negative multiplisers.


### RequiresAny & RequiresAll

Example
```json
"RequiresAny": {
    "Cards": [
        {"Name": "Card1", "Level": 1},
        {"Name": "Card2", "Level": 3},
    ],
    "Stats": {
      "StatRequirements": [
        {"Name":  "Damage", "Value": 8999},
        {"Name":  "Corruption", "Value": 10},
      ],
      "RequirementType": "Min"
    }
},
```

#### Cards
A list of cards that are required. Each entry looks like this:
```json
{"Name": "Card1", "Level": 2},
```

`Name` is the internal name of the card, `Level` is the minimum level.

So in the above example, the requirement is fulfilled if you have `Card1` at `Level` 2 in your inventory.

#### Stats
Stat requirements are more complex. An entry looks like this:
```json
"Stats": {
  "StatRequirements": [
    {"Name": "Damage", "Value": 8999},
    {"Name": "Corruption", "Value": 10},
  ],
  "RequirementType": "Min"
}
```

`StatRequirements` contains a list of stats `Stat` names and values to fulfill. `RequirementType` specifies if the stat requirements are `Min`(imums) or `Max`(imums).

That means, the above example translates to:
`For this card to show up, the player must have AT LEAST 8999 Damage and AT LEAST 10 Corruption`.

If we were to change the `RequirementType` to `Max`, it would change to `For this card to show up, the player must have at LESS THAN 8999 Damage and LESS THAN 10 Corruption`.

### Effects
This is a list of effects that are applied to the card.

#### Name
An optional name for the effect. This is only used for debug logs and will be auto-generated if not provided. 

#### Type
